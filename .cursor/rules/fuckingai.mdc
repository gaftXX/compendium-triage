Never do anything in additon to what i specifcly asked, dont add new fetaures that you think might be good for the theme. be as direct as possible, no other feature, only features that make the that feature work

never create mocj function, allways do the real thing

only run build for the dmg file when i ask, never do it on you own.

never ever add emojis
