Monitor emerging trends, project announcements, or policy changes impacting architecture. Review the market, create speculations and generate insights that might be lost on the small spectrum within architecture offices. Create connections and employ multiple ways for displaying collected data. This software is the defining point of change, and a complement to a revolution in architecture.

The art of the software is portrayed in the fundamental defining features: general orchestrator, a centralized orchestra for executing any action without the bounds of the software, using the possibilities of AI for automation and further inquiries outside of the software. Note system, automatically parse unstructured input, identify data type, extract relevant fields, and save to the correct data collection.
Market consolidation algorithms, comprehensive market intelligence system that employs advanced mathematical metrics (HHI, Gini coefficients, CR4/CR8 ratios) and network analysis algorithms to track architecture industry consolidation patterns, M&A activities, pricing power shifts, and competitive dynamics across 7 core categories with 20+ specific metrics for strategic market analysis.
Further features after core build are as follows - 24/7 background automation - Network graph analysis - Pulse retrieval system (automated daily data collection) - In-look scraper (on demand data retrieval)

Just as the function of the app is counted as art, so are the aesthetics of the interface an important part of the software in use. The Cross is the centerpiece of the app's capabilities, an art piece that complements the unusual way of the general orchestrator's manipulation of the app. A general engine functioning as an Autopoietic system that is self-producing and self-maintaining entities that continuously regenerate their own components through internal processes. A general component library, app-wide engine that controls every action to remove the possibility of micro-managing actions and results of those actions. - Self-Production - Boundary Maintenance - Operational Closure - Structural Coupling - Autonomy. As an example -

Biological Systems: The classic example of a living cell, which regenerates its membrane, enzymes, and DNA through metabolic networks. Multicellular organisms, like humans, can be seen as autopoietic at the organism level: from embryo to adult, the body self-organizes growth, repairs tissues, and maintains homeostasis without external blueprints dictating every step.
